			<h2>Week 2 Wireframe Blog</h2>

			<p>Since week 1's blog template was done in a hurry, much of the planned structure was simplified and I will be reimplementing the full structure this week as well as adding responsive design.</p>

			<p>The side navigation bar on the left with links to previous posts was coded to have fixed size last week and now it will be fluid size with fixed position.  Same with the sidebar on the right with external links.  Each set of links will also now be coded as unorder lists to clean up the visual formatting for clarity.</p>

			<p>The footer that was omitted from last week's design will be added back in the same style as Facebook where it is the last block of the right sidebar.</p>

			<p>The header didn't have the text aligned to center last week, so it will be centered now.  The text will also be a link back to the index of my site.</p>
			
			<p>Titles were also conspicuously absent from last week's blog template.  Other minor changes were made.</p>

			<p>There isn't a wireframe graphic for this, but in order for this to be more accessible to smartphones and tablets, the nav sidebar will be eliminated for both tablet and smartphone resolutions and the external links and footer will be moved to below the content area in smartphone view</p>
