			<h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>

            <p>By far the biggest stereotype threat that I have faced did not involve academic performance directly, but affected my performance quite dramatically.  Growing up as a technically brainy Asian kid, I always felt more comfortable around technology than people and that preference was fostered instead of compensated for.  As a result, the development of my social skills was handicapped and that handicap compounded as the years went by.  It exploded when I went to college, where a lot of the work required collaboration, and I suddenly found myself having to learn quickly how to work with people on a level I was never comfortable with working.  Add that to the envy I had of others with their abilities to interact, I retreated deeper into the hole I was in when it was the worst thing I could do and my schoolwork, even my favorite of subject of Math, suffered heavily forcing me to withdraw from some of what would have been my favorite classes.</p>
			
			<p>After years of difficulty, I found a solution.  Though there wasn't anything I could immediately do about how difficult it was to interact, I could at least put myself in a position where the awkwardness was a non-factor and that was to fully embrace school spirit and attend hockey games regularly.  Admittedly I only went to my first game because of a crush I had on one of the cheerleaders at the time, but once there I got so wrapped up in the culture that it was a place I wanted to stay.  Sure there was a lot of interacting, but because fans were there to watch the game, it was broken down into brief segments between plays and I could treat one as a new conversation.</p>
			
			<p>This also allowed me numerous opportunities to showcase my other soft skills with people.  The LEGO brand children's building toy, for instance, has been something I've continually employed.  Since it's becoming increasing normal for adults to have hobbies that involve toys, it's something that people readily accepted of me and also established me as a fixture at home games.  I've developed strong friendships with the Men's Hockey Office, the Spirit Squads, and different fan groups that continue to this day and I often create little LEGO gifts for each of them.</p>
