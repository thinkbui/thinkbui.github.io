		<p>Hello, my name is Ian Bui and I am a member of the <i>SF Firecrackers</i> cohort for DBC.  Growing up as a son of an IBMer, I've been surrounded by technology my whole life and am very interested in what I can do with the equipment that's available.<br />It started out with just simple games and applications on pre-laptop portable computers, but then when the Internet came into everyone's households with affordable service and the creation of the World Wide Web, it quickly turned to programming in HTML, which I taught myself by studying other pages' source codes.  Then in high school, it was BASIC for TI calculator and went on to assembly, C/C++, Java and many other languages in college, work, and personal exploration.</p>
		<p>I am a graduate of the <b>University of Minnesota</b> in the Twin Cities as I like to stay close to home.  I am very proud of my alma mater and maintain strong connections there even after I graduated.  My degrees, in order of earning them, are:<p>
		<ol>
			<li>Mathematics</li>
			<li>Electrical Engineering</li>
			<li>Computer Engineering</li>
			<li>Computer Science</li>
		</ol>
		<p id="white">As part of my pride for my alma mater, I am a huge hockey fan becoming a season ticket holder for the school's team and having friends throughout the program.  It really started out with a crush I had on one of the cheerleaders (naturally) compelling me to go to one of the games, but as soon as I did, it became almost entirely about the hockey.<br />
		Part of it still is about the cheerleaders though as since then I've established a strong friendship with the cheer team as kind of an uncle figure who gives them presents on special occassions.</p>
