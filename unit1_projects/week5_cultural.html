			<h2>Phase 0 Pair Programming Feedback</h2>

            <p>Communication seems to be a motif in my struggles in Phase 0 Pair Programming.  It's always been a weak spot for me, so it shouldn't be a great surprise that it's rearing its ugly head here.  Though I tackle individual symptoms of this, another shows up and takes its place as the weekly challenges require more coordination all the time.  Over the past two weeks of unit 2, the main symptom was not adequately informing my partner that because of my connection, I was receiving them at a delay and led to strange silences and instances where it sounded to them like I was ignore what they were saying among other awkward moments.  To mitigate these effects, I suppose I should, for instance, reboot my machine and reset my router beforehand, but that doesn't avoid the fact that I need to continue to be vigilant about how I communicate with others and visa-versa without being afraid that their feedback somehow says that they hate me.</p>
			
			<p>On a related note, I made the mistake of waiting until today to read feedback from the past two weeks.  Granted I just had two weeks of bizarre scheduling problems, but I need to be mindful of how important feedback is to working with others and spending 20 seconds or so here and there to read them between challenges instead of jumping from one directly to another could have at least dampened a lot of the awkwardness.</p>
