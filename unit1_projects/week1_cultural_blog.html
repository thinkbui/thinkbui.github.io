			<h2>Week 1 Cultural Blog</h2>

			<p>As I finish off the first week of phase 0, I think my own fears are getting in the way of truly understanding of what to expect when I arrive in San Francisco in July.  I've always been afraid of trying new things, especially something far different from an academic environment as DBC is, so my mind automatically races with thoughts of everything I need to do before I leave, what I need to make sure is taken care of at home while I am there, and what I need to bring with me.  I know the camp is full of people like me and I know the cohort was carefully selected so that everyone can work with everyone including myself, but this is such a new adventure for me.  I am fully aware that there will be times when my limits will be tested and times when my patience, but this is something I'd feel a lot more comfortable doing closer to home.</p>

			<p>At the same time, I know that going to the Bay Area for this has huge benefits with it being a part of the country I haven't lived in and its proximity to Silicon Valley offering connections to strong tech companies.  DBC was highly recommended to me by a leader in Silicon Valley, so as many anxieties as I have, I know that DBC is where I belong.</p>

			<p>Specific to reaction from the video, none of the notions I've had have changed as I continue to have very unspecific expectations of DBC.  I suppose it's kind of a defense mechanism to be kept from being disappointed.  I do fear about my ability of smashing through social boundaries that I am not used to crossing, but knowing that I will be working with people similar to me helps me understand that it will be a team effort to do so along the way.</p>
