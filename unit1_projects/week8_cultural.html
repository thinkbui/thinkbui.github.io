			<h2>Conflict</h2>

            <p>Emotional conflicts are something that I tend to push out of my mind.  Maybe it's because I'd rather not deal with it or that emotions ran so high that the details got greatly distorted, but in any case I usually come away focusing on next time rather than remembering what happened.  Typically it's something I feel I was being led on about that turned out not be true.  Sometimes I was actually being misled and other times it was the fault of my own assumptions.  I could go on the offensive about it and confront the people I think wronged me or I could just withdraw and boil about it.  When I am confrontational, I usually feel better afterwards even if I lose.  When I withdraw, it could be because I don't want to deal with the person anymore or I want to be mad and because I let it go unresolved, I feel worse about it.  In the end I trust people a little less and the degree I do depends on the situation.</p>
