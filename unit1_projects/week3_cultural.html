			<h2>W3 Cultural Blog</h2>

            <p>Having a concrete sequential thinking style, I knew I would relish a structured environment that I can't get from learning on my own.  When teaching myself something new, I always needed a specific goal in mind.  For example when I taught myself jQuery, I needed to work towards a web-based gallery template that I could reuse if the need arose.  With DBC, the goals are already set for me with the established curriculum, so I know I can succeed in the technical part of the camp with my passion for software development.</p>
			
			<p>One of the biggest challenges with concrete sequential thinking is working in groups.  I can do that in face-to-face environments, but it's not as easy for me when working remotely since I tend to rely on other people reading my body language and seeing what I see without my helping them.  Like I've said in reflections, it's something that I need to be conscious of during future pairing sessions.  I don't think it'll be a long term problem as long as I keep at it.</p>
