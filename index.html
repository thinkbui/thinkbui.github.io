      <h2>Ian's Code Examples</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to my list of portfolio of simple(ish) code examples.  Most of these are made for my personal use, but you are welcome to study them as they might have value to you as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing to note is that this website was originally built as an HTML blog before it was repurposed, so its own code has some smells that I will periodically clean up over time.
